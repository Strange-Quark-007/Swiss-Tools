# Swiss Army Tank - Dev Tools

A browser-based, modular, and privacy-first toolbox that offers a suite of fast, lightweight utilities. The app is built to help developers with tools ranging from number conversions to data manipulation, and everything in between. It's designed to be responsive, cross-platform, and entirely privacy-respecting with no tracking or ads.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Each tool (e.g., number conversion, data conversion) is separate and can be added or removed dynamically.
- **Customizable Sidebar**: Easily organize tools by categories like "Developer Tools" or "Designer Tools." Sidebar modules can be pinned or customized by the user.
